# NEXT LOCATION
## Problem:
- Why should convention be normalised in the age of data and computation?
- Why should businesses restrict their advertising locations based on intuition?
- Is there an opportunity for companies to advertise better by simply being in a more unconventional place?



## Solution:
- A one-stop solution for companies to see which specific spots are best suited for setting up billboards and/ or ATMs, in their area of operation.
- Various parameters such as population density, local surroundings, daily human migration and footfall, etc. will be taken into consideration.
- This will put an end to endless meetings and data analysis for each company that wish to use our service.



## Tech Stack Used:
- Flutter :  We are designing our app using flutter.
- Machine Learning : We'll be training Machine Learning models to predict the desired locations.
- HERE REST APIs : We'll be using Here Rest APIs like Map Image API, Map Image API and Traffic API
